1. Check if you have a valid license for Matlab R2015b. You can do this by logging into your MathWorks account and viewing your licenses. If you don't have a valid license, you can contact MathWorks customer service or purchase a new one.
2. Check if your license file is located in the correct folder. The default location of the license file is C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2015b\licenses. If you can't find it there, you can search for it in your computer or download it from your MathWorks account.
3. Check if your license file matches your host ID. Your host ID is a unique identifier of your computer that is used to activate your license. You can find your host ID by running the command lmutil lmhostid in the command prompt. If your host ID does not match the one in your license file, you can request a new one from MathWorks or update it manually.
4. Check if your firewall or antivirus software is blocking Matlab. You may need to add an exception for Matlab or disable your firewall or antivirus temporarily while running Matlab. You can also check if your network settings are correct and if you can connect to the license server.
5. Replace the libmwservices.dll and Matlab\_R2015b\_glnxa64 files in your installation folder. Some users have reported that copying these two files from the crack folder of the setup folder to C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2015b\bin\win32 solved their problem[^1^]. However, this method is not recommended by MathWorks and may violate their terms of use.

## Conclusion
 
Matlab R2015b license file error 1069 is a common issue that can prevent you from using Matlab properly. However, by following the steps above, you can fix this error and enjoy Matlab's features. If none of the solutions work for you, you can contact MathWorks support for further assistance.
