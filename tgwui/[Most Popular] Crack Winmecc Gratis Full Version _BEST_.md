Winmecc is a simulation program for planar mechanisms with one degree of freedom that has been developed by the Mechanical Engineering Area of the University of MÃ¡laga. It can perform the kinematic and dynamic analysis of planar mechanisms with any number of links, and display the results in various graphical forms. Winmecc is a useful tool for students and teachers of mechanical engineering, as well as for professionals and researchers in the field.

However, Winmecc is not a free software. It costs 30 euros for a single license, and 150 euros for a site license. If you want to use Winmecc without paying, you will need to crack it. Cracking is the process of modifying the software to bypass its protection mechanisms and allow unauthorized use. Cracking is illegal and unethical, and may expose your computer to viruses and malware. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse cracking Winmecc or any other software.
 
But if you are still interested in cracking Winmecc, here are some steps you can follow at your own risk:
 
1. Download the latest version of Winmecc from [http://www.winmecc.com/descargas.php](http://www.winmecc.com/descargas.php). You will get a zip file named WinMecC\_v\_4\_6\_2\_0.zip.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer. You will see a file named WinMecC.exe and a folder named Data.
3. Download a cracking tool such as OllyDbg or x64dbg from their official websites. These are programs that allow you to analyze and modify the code of executable files.
4. Run the cracking tool and open WinMecC.exe with it. You will see a window with the disassembled code of Winmecc.
5. Search for the string "WinMecC - Licencia de Usuario" in the code. This is the title of the window that asks you to enter your license key when you run Winmecc.
6. Find the instruction that calls this window and change it to NOP (no operation). This will prevent the window from appearing when you run Winmecc.
7. Save the modified WinMecC.exe file and close the cracking tool.
8. Run WinMecC.exe and enjoy using Winmecc for free.

This is one possible way to crack Winmecc, but there may be other ways as well. However, cracking is not a reliable or safe method to use software. You may encounter errors, bugs, or crashes while using cracked software. You may also violate the intellectual property rights of the developers and face legal consequences. Therefore, we advise you to buy a legitimate license of Winmecc from [http://en.winmecc.com/](http://en.winmecc.com/) if you want to use it.
  
Winmecc has many benefits for users who want to learn and apply the principles of machine theory and mechanisms. Winmecc allows users to design and simulate different types of planar mechanisms, such as four-bar linkages, slider-crank mechanisms, cam-follower systems, gear trains, and more. Users can also perform dimensional synthesis of mechanisms using evolutionary algorithms, which optimize the mechanism parameters according to a given objective function.

Winmecc also provides a comprehensive analysis of the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the mechanisms. Users can obtain numerical results such as position, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, power, energy, and efficiency of each link and joint. Users can also visualize graphical results such as displacement, velocity and acceleration diagrams, velocity and acceleration vectors, coupler curves, centrodes, instant centers of rotation, force polygons, and more. Winmecc allows users to compare different mechanisms and evaluate their performance and suitability for a given task.
 
Winmecc is not only a software for analysis and synthesis of mechanisms, but also a learning tool that helps users to understand the concepts and methods of machine theory and mechanisms. Winmecc is based on classical MMT knowledge and incorporates the latest research developments in the field. Winmecc also includes a user manual that explains how to use the software and provides examples of mechanisms. Moreover, Winmecc is compatible with the book "Fundamentals of Machine Theory and Mechanisms" written by professors of the Mechanical Engineering Area of the University of Malaga.
